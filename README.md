Wicks And Wrivets
=================

This is a Minecraft mod created for Modfest 2024.


## Development Setup
1. Ideally, put Axiom or whatever you like for building into `run/mods`.
2. Run once and create a world. If folder "dimension\wikwriv\wikwriv" does not exist, enter the dimension. <br>
   MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA GOT FROM `src/main/resources/dimension_data` COPIED INTO THE FOLDER!!!. 
3. Delete `src/main/resources/dimension_data`.
4. Create a link between that folder and the `src/main/resources/dimension_data` folder.  <br>
   Sample Windows Command(You need to change the directories): `mklink /J 
   "D:\Code\Minecraft\WicksAndWrivets\src\main\resources\dimension_data"  
   "D:\Code\Minecraft\WicksAndWrivets\run\saves\DevWorld\dimensions\wikwriv"`
