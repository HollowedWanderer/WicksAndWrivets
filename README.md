Wicks And Wrivets
=================

This is a Minecraft mod created for Modfest 2024.


## Development Setup
1. Ideally, put Axiom or whatever you like for building into `run/mods`.
2. Run once and create a world *with "dev"* in the name. <br>
   MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA GOT FROM `src/main/resources/dimension_data` COPIED INTO ITS FOLDER!!!.
3. Make sure that they actually get commited. Maybe this can help: `git config core.symlinks true`

How to get into the dimension:
```
/execute in wikwriv:wikwriv run tp 0 1 0
```
